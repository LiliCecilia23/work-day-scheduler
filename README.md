Deployed Application: https://lilicecilia23.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

This webpage is a work day scheduler that allows you to input events from 9AM-6PM each day.
Each hour block is color coded to indicate past, present, and future according to when the
user is accessing the page. You can save the contents of the input fields with the save/lock
button, which saves them to local storage so they will still be there even if the user refreshes
the page.
